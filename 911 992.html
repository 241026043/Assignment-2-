      <div class="col"><p1>The 2025 Porsche 911 (992.2) brings several exciting updates, including the introduction of hybrid technology for 
	  the first time in the model's history. The Carrera GTS now features a 3.6-liter flat-six engine paired with Porsche's new T-Hybrid system. 
	  This system includes an electric exhaust gas turbocharger and a permanent magnet synchronous motor, 
	  contributing to a significant power boost. The Carrera GTS produces up to 398 kW (533 hp) and 610 Nm (450 lb-ft) of torque, 
	  enabling a 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of just 3.0 seconds for the rear-wheel-drive version.</p1></div>

      <div class="col"><p1>In terms of design, the 2025 911 maintains its iconic look with subtle refinements, such as new wheel designs, matrix LED
	  headlights, and a revised rear end with a full-width LED light strip. The interior has also seen updates, including a 12.6-inch fully digital 
	  instrument cluster and a push-button starter replacing the traditional key or rotary dial.
      The base Carrera models also benefit from enhancements, like a slight power increase and a more efficient twin-turbo 3.0-liter flat-six engine.
	  All 911 variants now come with rear-wheel steering, improving handling and stability.</p1></div>
